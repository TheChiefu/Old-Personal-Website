# Old-Personal-Website

This is a dump of my website I made when I was bored in highschool (around 2016). I never ended up hosting it since as a highschooler I didn't have income so therefore couldn't afford to host it. This was before I learned how to program in C# or C++ so I did the HTML/CSS by hand. I knew about Adobe Dreamweaver and othersites but enjoyed manually writing the website myself in my free time. It also acted as a quick download site for applications I used often whenever I would wipe my PC clean after a long time of use.
