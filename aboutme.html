		<p style="margin-top: -40px"><font class="resize">H</font>ello, I am Austin Lanphear; also known online through my aliases as <i><b>The Chiefu, thechief120, AustinAwsome</b></i>, and
		and many numerous in-game names I go by. I am a 17 year old male who love video games, computers, nature, and orchestral music; these are hobbies that are intertwined with one another.
		My love for computers and gaming came at an early age, every since I could remember I was always playing video games and using the family computer. Over time this interest grew, I wanted
		to create new things on my computer and I wanted to make video games on them; as time when on I knew how the basics of 3D Modeling and Level Designing, using tools such as Unity and Blender.
		As I grew older I wanted to self teach myself new ideas, so I started to learn HTML, CSS, some Javascript, C#, and as a normal language Japanese. The want of learning these languages stemed
		from my interest in wanting to make video games, while wanting to learn Japanese comes from my interesting in wanting to move to Japan, but thats a story for later.

		So you want to learn the entire story? You're going to be in for a long ride, this article is dedicated towards describing all of what I remember in life, documenting the important parts in my life.

	<p> <h1><u>Early Childhood: (1999-2003)</u></h1>
		It was June 10th, 1999 and I had been brought onto my hometown; Westerly, Rhode Island, United States of America. I didn't remember much of search early years, all I remember is the day
		my father and mother moved from their original house to my grandparent's house (father's side); I was around 2-3 years old at the time. Years went on and eventually my mother moved out, but
		my brother and I stayed with my father at my grandparent's house. When I was 4 years old I attended the <a href="http://bit.ly/2fuhwwA">Dunns Corners Community Church</a>, everything was new to me and I didn't like school very
		much at the time because it took me away from video games. At around this age I discovered my interest in computers and video games, I loved the Nintendo consoles because I played my father's

		Super Nintendo; I loved playing Donkey Kong Country and Super Mario World. Around or before the same age when I visted my mother like I did every week-end at that age I played the Nintendo 64 
		and discovered my favorite video game of all time, <b>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</b>. I loved this game with such a passion that every opportunity that I could I would want to play it.
		Not much I remembered happened until Elementary School; by this time I discovered a new favorite game series of mine <b>Halo</b>; I loved the gameplay mechanics of both game series and these to this day
		are my favorite game series of all time.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h1><u>Elementary Age: (2004-2009)</u></h1>
		Once I turned of age to be in Elementary School, I went from the pre-school to the <a href="http://bit.ly/2f3bQXv">Dunns Corners Elementary School</a>. Elementary School was when I started to
		remember more important aspects of my life. At this age I still really didn't like school that much, it was the same reasoning as before, I didn't want to leave my video games behind. But other than the
		one annoyance that was school, my life was changing in a vast way. Every weekend I would either hang out at my cousin's house or they'd come to ours, we'd film family videos because we liked watching
		movies together so we'd want to record and make our own. One of our finished products was named, <b>The B.A.M Show</b>; it was a collage of our skits that we made combined with videos we found online that
		we put in as commercial breaks. Since we were making the video ourself in Windows Movie Maker on Windows XP, we looked for commercials online and for some odd reason we choose to put "banned" commercials
		in our video. Sadly I don't have the original video anymore, my cousin might if I ask her and I will gladly provide it here. However this wasn't our first "film", the first finished video we ever made was
		named <b>James Micheal Micheals 2</b>; what or where is the original? 
		
		
		
		I wasn't involved with it because the idea created by my cousin Brandon has only my brother and himself in the orginal video.
		But once he asked me to be in the second one I agreed; without knowing what any of the script he wrote meant considering I was only 7. Apparently the video was about 2 male strippers who were trying to be
		stopped by a man called "Dr.Evil" (my cousin just took the name), because he hated them for their flamboyant nature. I was placed as one of the male strippers, but don't worry the video is completely safe,
		my cousin wanted to create his own script and we just followed. I still recorded videos until around middle school until my cousin Bailey and I recorded our final "movie", <b>Major Betrayel</b> which consisted
		on two soilders who fought in a war for survival until one turned on another. But I digress, middle school is to be told later on. 

	</p>
	<p>
		When I was around 8 years old I created my Gmail account that I still use to this day and started making websites
		online; using such tools as www.freewebs.com , www.wix.com , and www.yola.net. These websites are still around but I don't use them anymore because I like to create the webpages from scatch
		since I know how to do so now versus then. As I grew up I came up with new ideas on a video game I wanted to make, I drew sketches on what ideas I wanted to be in my game
		such as items and maps. These ideas were a direct inspiration from the video games series <b>The Legend of Zelda</b>, more specificly <b>Ocarina of Time</b> considering that was the first
		video game I had ever played. When I got these new ideas I wanted to make them a reality but I didn't know how make them a reality, so I searched online; years later I found a couple of game engines but
		those were expensive, until I found <a href="http://www.unity3d.com/">Unity 3D</a>. At the time it was still considered a hobbyist game engine that no one took too seriously, but for someone
		who was 10 years old at the time, it was the most amazing program in the world. Continuning on, I still went to my cousins house on the week-end but it soon shifted towards my grandparent's house
		on my mother's side. My brother, cousins, and I went over to their house and that's where such films as James Micheal Micheals was created at. That house is where I remember most of my elementary school
		age at; we wrote our heights on a support in the furnished basement which was where most of us slept and played around in. Since I had access to that computer wanted to try to make my own music for two reasons, one
		I wanted to create orchestral music because its one my favorite music genre (mostly because of video games), and two I wanted to make music for video games, so I used a program called Mixcraft to try and make music.
		When I was there I played on the computer my grandfather let us use, as well as the original Xbox where I played games like Halo on. Since it was the weekend whenever I stayed over there; my brother and I would watch Cartoon Network and Nick on the TV, my favorite shows between
		the networks was <b> Dragon Ball Z, Ed Edd and Eddy, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, etc.</b> This continued on until middle school, where they my grandparent's moved out of that house and to a new one in Charlestown.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h1><u>Middle School Age: (2009-2013)</u></h1>
		It was up until this age that everything in my life went consistantly without much change, but it was at this time 2010; that my brother and I were given an option. Either we could stay living at my grandmother's house
		in Westerly or move to my mother's house. Excitedly, I said yes and I moved not far (really only across Route 1) to my mother's house and got my own room to stay in. I quickly unpacked all of my things; my brother and I
		had to split our items because we used to live in the same room at my grandparent's home. I was excited, I moved to this new house and was going into the new middle school; everything was so new and exciting.

		&nbsp; The video that got me interested into the Touhou game, as well as Japanese  &nbsp; animation and language.
		</p>
		
		</div>
		
		By this time, my grandmother missed us living with her so she proposed that every Friday after school my brother and I could eat out with her and my grandfather. I still to this day to this, it's just slightly
		cheaper considering eating at a restaurant got expensive quick. Pretty much everything had settled in at that point and I still loved to play video games, but now I had my own computer to use; I mostly watched YouTube on it
		and messed around on Newgrounds. Once I took my first bus ride back home from the Middle School I realized that one of my friends lived very close by and we often would bike ride around the neighborhood on the summer weekends.
		Once it got to December and the first Christmas came at the new house I lived in my mother told me to make a list of what I wanted, since it had been forever since I watched shows like Dragon Ball, and I loved all the games
		that went with the series I asked for the DVD sets, this started my interest in Japanese Animation. At one point I started to try and learn Japanese when I was around 11 years old because I thought the language sounded cool; 
		as well as that that type of animation was gaining popularity on YouTube and had been established on Newgrounds. This type of animation intriuged me and I often watched videos on YouTube on the topic, that's where I discovered
		the game series <b>Touhou</b>, a "Bullet Hell" game where you have to dodge as many projecticles as you can on the 2-D playing field. When I found out about this game, it gave me the kick I needed to start wanting to game
		design again.
	</p>
	<p>
		My interest in game design has always been around, ever since Elementary School when our teachers told us to draw something every day or so I'd draw whatver I was playing at the time and add on to it. So when I finally had my
		own computer to use I wanted to make something, but didn't know how. I still drew on paper ideas that I wanted to be come reality, the addition I had was my I-pod which I recorded sound with. Even though I wasn't creating much
		other than sound, at the time I felt like I was creating something new and amazing. Whenever I went to my grandparnent's house in Charlestown I'd think of these new ideas for games I wanted to make. Similar to before my grandparent's
		moving my cousins and I still went to their house in Charlestown. This was the location at which we recorded the BAM show, and where my interest in nature really took off; considering every time there was days off of school or vacation time
		I'd go there.

		This was the start of me documenting my life on the internet for the first time; this was a video of one of my old friends and I playing Terraria. My voice comes in at around 2:23.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		
		The house was in the woods and intially the yard was filled with leaves, but whenever I had the time I raked paths that went from the side of the house towards a large rock; I even created my own mini-campsite because I
		loved it out there. Whenever I stayed inside I played on the computer my grandfather had for everyone to use, I'd often watch videos on the Universe that were on YouTube for hours and hours on the channel named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1znqKFL3jeR0eoA0pHpzvw">Space Rip</a>.
		I loved learning about the Universe so much so that when it came to school, I often excelled in every science aspect possible but fell short in most other aspects such as English and Math. I continued going to my grandparent's house every
		weekend until 2014 in which, my mother moved from Westerly into my aunt's house in Charlestown. Again I was excited to go to the new house, but soon was devistated to hear that I had to transfer to a new school; and that I didn't have a room anymore.
		I moved in and was in denial, so much so that I forgot to tell my friends from Westerly that I was moving because I didn't think I was moving, even to the first day of school at the Chariho Middle School.
		Luckly I grew up living with the internet at a young age so I didn't lose contact with my old friends even when I was transitioning to the High School, a year later. This was the time in which I started to record with my friends online because
		I thought I would like seeing old funny videos of us later on, and post them to YouTube.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
		<h1><u>High School Age: (2013-2017):</u></h1>
		After fully moving into my Aunt's house, I started to get used to it, considering the house was directly next-door to my grandparent's house. So all the work I put outside could be extended from their yard into the new yard I had yet to claim.
		I sat through the horrible transition of transfering schools to a major plus, so when I finally made new friends at Chariho the negative of transfering went away. At that point in life I talked to my friends from Westerly exclusively online, and
		my friends from Chariho exclusively at school. Like usual I would go to my grandparent's house on the weekend, and this time instead of using his computer that he lets people use my father and him as a birthday present built a computer for me to use.

		A video of my old computer setup when I lived at my grandparent's house, &nbsp; before I moved out of the house when my grandparent's moved.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		
		So I could play games I normally couldn't with a $200 prebuilt computer; and since they lived next door my mother allowed me to live at their house from then on. So I moved into my grandparent's house. They gave me a room to sleep in and my all of my
		electronics and computer were all in one area that I made into my own "gaming station" in the basement. This was the turning point in my life when if came to pretty much aspect on how I ran my life; before it consisted of me coming home everyday from
		school by being woken up and coming home playing video games, the only indepence being what I did in my free time. Now that I lived at my grandparent's house I had to make sure everything I did stayed clean, I woke myself up, started learning how to do
		more video editing, learning how to build my own computer, started to really learn how to do game design, and taking full control of what classes I took at school and how I performed was how much effort I put in. This was the happiest time in my life, at
		that moment I felt like an adult, doing things own my own (other than working, paying, taxes, driving; the actual things you do as an adult). It was that point in life in which my friends from Westerly would record games with me and I started buiding my
		channel on YouTube. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever Summer came, I went to my original home in Westerly at my other grandparent's house so I could spend time with my grandparent's. When it came to game design, it was the summer time when I really took the time to learn about it.
		I learned about the program Blender forever ago, at the start of 8th grade but I never came around to learn it; the summer was that time. I 3D moddled swords, chairs, etc (mostly inanimate objects) and put them into Unity, I really felt like a game designer;
		all these years of drawing dungeons and items was finally becoming a reality. One summer I make a mini-dungeon, I never fully completed it in the sense of gameplay because I had no enemies but the layout was essentially complete. I even felt confident enough to
		start learning Japanese, because at this point in life I knew almost exactly what I wanted to do after College. My plan was to major in Game Design or Interactive Media in colledge and move Tokyo or Osaka to become a game designer there. So because I wanted
		to move abroad I started self-teaching myself during the summer at <a href="http://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a> where I learned Hirigana「ひりがな」, Katakana「カタカナ」, and some Kanji「漢字」; the basis of the Japanese language. My reasoning for my want to move to Japan came from numerous sources,
		one being that a large amount of games I played origined from Japan, my favorite shows came from Japan, and my interest in wanting to learn new language; another reasoning being that I've always wanted to move to a different country. 
		An example sentence that I constructed using only the knowledge I self taught myself would be: こんにちは私はオースティンですはじめまして。ぼくは学習日本語好きです！じゃまた。 Meaning, "Hello my name is Austin nice to meet you. I like learning Japanese! See you later", in such case I used
		the formal 私 "I" instead of the informal "ぼく" Male or Tomboy usage of "I" in the case of keeping formality; yet at the end I say "じやまた" which is an informal way of saying "see you later" because although it's informal I like to be seen as a mix between
		formal and friendly. By keeping the respect by using formal language at first than transitioning into friendly or less strict language essentially states that I don't want to be seen as strict or stern.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was having the best time in my life, but life isn't always fair; as 10th grade was approaching troubling news hit me. My grandparent's had to move because my great grandmother needed money so she kicked my grandparents out of their house on mother's day
		to fund herself. She sold the house and I had to move back home, I pouted because I knew I would have to move back to having no room or personal space for my items. I moved back home into the living-room/kitchen area and I was livid, I didn't like this change at all;
		I thought it could never get worse. How naive I was, I had Unknowingly walked into the worst year of my life; 10th grade 2015. I went from having the best time in my life at my grandparents to, no privacy, depressed, and put-down shell of who I was in 2015. I started
		out 10th grade with high-hopes, 9th grade was a blast and I was ready to take on school; I was just a bit urked from moving back to my aunt's. The year started out okay, then my Math grades made a problem because I stuggled, French proved to be a test considering I failed a
		semester by 0.5 of a point and had to take it again next year, I had my first pass-out in my life, and everything went downhill afterwards. Not only was the school year horrendous because I felt depressed due to what had happened, but since I always talk to my friends
		during the summer I expected to same to happen again the next year. But to no avail, no one I knew was online for most of the summer, so I felt lonely for an entire summer. Luckly, when 11th grade came my attitude came around, I finally felt hopeful again, I lost my
		sense of independence and confidence however but that slowly has been rebuilding since 11th grade. My junior year of high-school in comparison to the year before was a much better year, I had excelled in almost all my classes, and I was getting past my struggles from the
		year from before, I turned that horrid experience of 10th grade into a learning experience on how to deal with such depression. When summer came again, I expected no one because when I expect nothing rather than nothing I am gladly suprised when something arises. But
		lucky for me I had my chariho friends to talk to over the summer, it was my best summer in a long time, I built a new computer, learned more japanese, and recorded more YouTube videos for my channel; and that leaves me with the current events.

	<h1><u>Conclusion</u></h1>
	<p>
		It's been a long jouney through life, I've gone through the good and I've gone through the bad <i>(some verbal/physical fights between adults from early childhood I excluded for obvious reasons)</i>. Although I've lived with not so rich parents, actually rather poor on the side of most people I've still manage
		to appreciate what oppurtunities I've been given and have loved my life. I thank my father's side of my grandparents as well as my father for keeping me in a hope and raising me, as well as my mother on the weekends for showing me new things in the world.
		Even though my parent's don't live with each other they don't hate each other, they prefer not to live with each other; which I respect considering how much they went to provide us with not only the nesscessities in life but also things we don't even need.
		Like I said before, even though my parents are rather on the poor side, they still saved money to buy us birthday and a surprising amount of gifts for Christmas even though they didn't need to. I never ask my parents for much, I tell them it's okay if
		they don't buy Christmas gifts if they need to save money. But like my mother said to me; because she didn't get much for gifts in her childhood she wants to give her children a childhood her mother didn't give her; which I can appricate. So in conclusion,
		I hope to finish my time in school and college; and head off into the world pursing what I love to do, make video games and live my dream. Thank you for those who took the time to read my auto-biography, I'll add on if any ideas rush back; I want to leave
		my mark on the world, not for bad but for good.
